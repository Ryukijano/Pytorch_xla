It's a follow-up to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/single-core-alexnet-fashion-mnist.ipynb), which trains the same network on the same dataset the using a single Cloud TPU core.

        "Additional notebooks demonstrating how to run PyTorch on Cloud TPUs can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/xla). While Colab provides a free Cloud TPU, training is even faster on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/pytorch/xla#Cloud), especially when using multiple Cloud TPUs in a Cloud TPU pod. Scaling from a single Cloud TPU, like in this notebook, to many Cloud TPUs in a pod is easy, too. You use the same code as this notebook and just spawn more processes."
